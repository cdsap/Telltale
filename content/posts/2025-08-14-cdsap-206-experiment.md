title: "AGP 9.0.0-alpha01 vs AGP 8.12"
date: 2025-08-14
report_link: /Telltale/reports/experiment_results_20250814234144.html
summary: " 
The analysis of Gradle build performance between two variants, `varianta_agp_8.12` and `variantb_agp_9-alpha01`, reveals a slight increase in overall build time in the newer variant by approximately 0.35 seconds (0.35% increase). The configuration time also shows a minor increase by about 0.09 seconds (2.15% increase). The most time-consuming tasks across both variants include `:core:cart:compileDebugKotlin`, `:core:identity:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:core:contact:compileDebugKotlin`, with marginal differences in execution times between the variants. Memory usage is slightly higher in `variantb_agp_9-alpha01` for all processes and specifically for build child processes. CPU usage remains nearly identical across both variants. The total garbage collection counts are slightly reduced in the newer variant."

The most time-consuming tasks across both variants include `:core:cart:compileDebugKotlin`, `:core:identity:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:core:contact:compileDebugKotlin`, with marginal differences in execution times between the variants. Memory usage is slightly higher in `variantb_agp_9-alpha01` for all processes and specifically for build child processes. CPU usage remains nearly identical across both variants. The total garbage collection counts are slightly reduced in the newer variant.
