summary: " 
The performance comparison between `varianta_main` and `variantb_z/metro` reveals that `variantb_z/metro` generally has a shorter build time with a mean reduction of 25.1% (6.622 seconds). Notably, `variantb_z/metro` also exhibits higher CPU usage in build child processes, suggesting more intensive parallel task execution. In the Kotlin Build Reports, `variantb_z/metro` shows a significant increase in Compiler IR translation time, which could indicate more complex translation processes. Memory usage is slightly lower in `variantb_z/metro` across all processes, contributing to its efficiency."

## Summary
The performance comparison between `varianta_main` and `variantb_z/metro` reveals that `variantb_z/metro` generally has a shorter build time with a mean reduction of 25.1% (6.622 seconds). Notably, `variantb_z/metro` also exhibits higher CPU usage in build child processes, suggesting more intensive parallel task execution. In the Kotlin Build Reports, `variantb_z/metro` shows a significant increase in Compiler IR translation time, which could indicate more complex translation processes. Memory usage is slightly lower in `variantb_z/metro` across all processes, contributing to its efficiency.
