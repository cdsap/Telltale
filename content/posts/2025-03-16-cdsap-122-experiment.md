## Summary
The Gradle build performance comparison data shows very similar performance between the two variants, with the difference in build times being less than 1%. The most time-consuming tasks were 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin', and ':core:model:compileKotlin', with minimal differences in execution times between the two variants. CPU usage was almost identical across all processes, while memory usage was slightly lower in variant B.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for variant A was 43.431 seconds, while for variant B it was 43.547 seconds, a difference of less than 1%. The P50 values were 43.464 and 43.574 seconds respectively, and the P90 values were 44.331 and 44.642 seconds.

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The most time-consuming tasks were 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin', and ':core:model:compileKotlin'.
   - The mean execution times for these tasks were very close between the two variants, with differences of less than 1%.
   - The P50 and P90 values for these tasks also showed minimal variations.

3. **Statistical Patterns**
   - The timing variations for the tasks were less than 10%, indicating consistent performance between the two variants.

4. **Process State Analysis**
   - The maximum CPU usage was almost identical for all processes in both variants, with values around 96%.
   - The maximum memory usage was slightly lower in variant B for all processes, with the most significant difference being in the main build process (1.77GB in variant A vs 1.5GB in variant B).

5. **CPU & Memory Usage Analysis**
   - The maximum CPU usage was very similar between the two variants for all processes, including the main build process and child processes.
   - The maximum memory usage was slightly lower in variant B for all processes, with the most significant difference being in the main build process.

6. **Garbage Collection Analysis**
   - This data is not available in the provided dataset.

7. **Kotlin Build Reports Analysis**
   - This data is not available in the provided dataset.

This analysis shows that the two variants have very similar performance, with minor differences in memory usage.
