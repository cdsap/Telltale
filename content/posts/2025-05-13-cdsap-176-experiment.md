summary: " 
The performance comparison between `varianta_main` and `variantb_lint_1.5g` reveals significant differences in build times and resource utilization. `variantb_lint_1.5g` shows a notable reduction in overall build time, clocking in at approximately 1057.511 seconds compared to `varianta_main`'s 1642.304 seconds, marking a decrease of around 35.6%. This variant also uses less memory, with a maximum of 11.64 GB compared to `varianta_main`'s 13.69 GB. However, CPU usage is slightly higher in `variantb_lint_1.5g` for the build process, peaking at 93.95% versus 92.00% in `varianta_main`."
