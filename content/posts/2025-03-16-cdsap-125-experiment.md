## Summary
The Gradle build performance comparison between `varianta_main_4g` and `variantb_main_6g` shows minor differences overall. The build time for both variants is almost identical, with `variantb_main_6g` being slightly faster on average. The most time-consuming task, `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, also performs similarly in both variants. The CPU usage is nearly the same across all processes, but `variantb_main_6g` uses less memory, particularly for the build process.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for `varianta_main_4g` is 43.15 seconds, and for `variantb_main_6g` it's 43.02 seconds, making `variantb_main_6g` 0.3% faster.
   - The P50 build time for both variants is nearly identical, with `variantb_main_6g` being slightly faster.
   - The P90 build time for `variantb_main_6g` is 4.3% faster than `varianta_main_4g`.

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The most time-consuming task, `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, has a mean execution time of 8.65 seconds for `varianta_main_4g` and 8.54 seconds for `variantb_main_6g`.
   - The task `:build-logic:convention:compileKotlin` takes slightly less time in `variantb_main_6g` across all percentiles.
   - The task `:core:model:compileKotlin` shows a negligible difference in execution times between the two variants.

3. **Statistical Patterns**
   - There are no tasks with notable timing variations greater than 10% between the two variants.

4. **Process State Analysis**
   - The maximum CPU usage is identical for both variants across all processes.
   - `variantb_main_6g` uses less memory in all processes. The most significant difference is in the build process, where `variantb_main_6g` uses 20% less memory.

5. **CPU & Memory Usage Analysis**
   - Both variants have similar CPU usage across all processes.
   - `variantb_main_6g` uses less memory in all processes, with the most significant difference being in the build process, where it uses 20% less memory.

**Note:** The data provided did not include information on Garbage Collection or Kotlin Build Reports, so these sections are omitted from the analysis.
