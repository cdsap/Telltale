## Summary
The build time for `varianta_main_6g` is slightly longer than `variantb_main_4g` by 586ms (2.5%). The most time-consuming tasks are `:app:hiltJavaCompileDemoDebug`, `:feature:foryou:kspProdDebugKotlin`, and `:feature:foryou:compileProdDebugKotlin`. The CPU usage is similar for both variants, but `varianta_main_6g` uses significantly more memory (up to 2.8GB more) in all processes.

## Detailed Report

**1. Build Time Comparison**
- `varianta_main_6g` has a mean build time of 23.49s, P50 of 23.63s, and P90 of 25.15s.
- `variantb_main_4g` has a mean build time of 22.90s, P50 of 22.79s, and P90 of 24.71s.
- `varianta_main_6g` takes 2.5% longer to build on average than `variantb_main_4g`.

**2. Task Type Differences**
