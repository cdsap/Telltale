## Summary
The Gradle build performance comparison between `varianta_main_4g` and `variantb_main_6g` shows minor differences. The overall build time is marginally faster in `variantb_main_6g` by about 0.7%. The most time-consuming tasks are similar across both variants, with minor differences in execution times. CPU usage is slightly higher in `variantb_main_6g` for all processes, but memory usage is lower. For the build process, CPU usage is slightly lower in `variantb_main_6g`, and memory usage is significantly lower by about 13.3%. For build child processes, CPU usage is slightly lower in `variantb_main_6g`, but memory usage is higher.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for `varianta_main_4g` is 43.961 seconds, while for `variantb_main_6g` it is 43.644 seconds, making `variantb_main_6g` about 0.7% faster.
   - The P50 build time for `varianta_main_4g` is 43.661 seconds, and for `variantb_main_6g` it is 43.332 seconds.
   - The P90 build time for `varianta_main_4g` is 47.501 seconds, and for `variantb_main_6g` it is 45.808 seconds.

2. **Task Type Differences**
