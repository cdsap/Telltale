summary: " 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals that variantb_main_6g generally performs slightly better than varianta_main_4g. The overall build time for variantb_main_6g is marginally less than varianta_main_4g. The most time-consuming tasks such as 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile' and ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin' also take less time in variantb_main_6g. However, the ':core:model:compileKotlin' task takes slightly more time in variantb_main_6g. In terms of resource usage, variantb_main_6g uses less memory but slightly more CPU in some cases."

## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals that variantb_main_6g generally performs slightly better than varianta_main_4g. The overall build time for variantb_main_6g is marginally less than varianta_main_4g. The most time-consuming tasks such as 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile' and ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin' also take less time in variantb_main_6g. However, the ':core:model:compileKotlin' task takes slightly more time in variantb_main_6g. In terms of resource usage, variantb_main_6g uses less memory but slightly more CPU in some cases.

   - The P50 build time for varianta_main_4g is 43.123 seconds, and for variantb_main_6g it is 43.110 seconds.
   - The P90 build time for varianta_main_4g is 44.703 seconds, while for variantb_main_6g it is 44.303 seconds.

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile' task takes on average 8.708 seconds in varianta_main_4g and 8.513 seconds in variantb_main_6g, a decrease of approximately 2.2%.
   - The ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin' task takes on average 12.277 seconds in varianta_main_4g and 11.872 seconds in variantb_main_6g, a decrease of approximately 3.3%.
   - The ':core:model:compileKotlin' task takes on average 5.140 seconds in varianta_main_4g and 5.155 seconds in variantb_main_6g, an increase of approximately 0.3%.

3. **CPU & Memory Usage Analysis**
   - The maximum CPU usage for all processes is 97.0% for varianta_main_4g and 96.5% for variantb_main_6g.
   - The maximum memory usage for all processes is 4.05 GB for varianta_main_4g and 3.93 GB for variantb_main_6g, a decrease of approximately 3%.
   - The maximum CPU usage for the build process is 83.3% for varianta_main_4g and 82.8% for variantb_main_6g.
   - The maximum memory usage for the build process is 1.71 GB for varianta_main_4g and 1.52 GB for variantb_main_6g, a decrease of approximately 11%.
   - The maximum CPU usage for build child processes is 87.7% for varianta_main_4g and 87.0% for variantb_main_6g.
   - The maximum memory usage for build child processes is 1.3 GB for varianta_main_4g and 1.37 GB for variantb_main_6g, an increase of approximately 5%.

Unfortunately, data for Kotlin Process State, Gradle Process State, total GC collections, and Kotlin Build Reports were not provided, so these sections could not be analyzed.
