## Summary
The Gradle build performance comparison data shows minor differences between the two variants. The overall build time is slightly faster in variantb_main_6g, with a mean build time of 43.296 seconds compared to 43.595 seconds in varianta_main_4g. The most time-consuming task, 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', also runs faster in variantb_main_6g. CPU usage is similar across both variants, but memory usage is slightly lower in variantb_main_6g for all processes and the build process, while it's higher for build child processes.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for varianta_main_4g is 43.595 seconds, while for variantb_main_6g it's 43.296 seconds, a difference of about 0.7%.
   - The P50 build time is slightly faster in variantb_main_6g (43.189 seconds) compared to varianta_main_4g (43.600 seconds).
   - The P90 build time is also faster in variantb_main_6g (45.375 seconds) compared to varianta_main_4g (45.901 seconds).

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The most time-consuming task, 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', takes less time in variantb_main_6g (mean: 8.484 seconds, P50: 8.343 seconds, P90: 12.102 seconds) compared to varianta_main_4g (mean: 8.703 seconds, P50: 8.252 seconds, P90: 14.060 seconds).
   - The task ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin' also takes less time in variantb_main_6g (mean: 11.858 seconds, P50: 11.879 seconds, P90: 12.331 seconds) compared to varianta_main_4g (mean: 12.351 seconds, P50: 11.966 seconds, P90: 14.488 seconds).
   - The task ':core:model:compileKotlin' has a slightly higher execution time in variantb_main_6g (mean: 5.111 seconds, P50: 5.092 seconds, P90: 5.299 seconds) compared to varianta_main_4g (mean: 5.056 seconds, P50: 5.077 seconds, P90: 5.208 seconds).

3. **Statistical Patterns**
   - The tasks 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile' and ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin' both show a notable timing decrease in variantb_main_6g compared to varianta_main_4g.
   - The task ':core:model:compileKotlin' shows a slight timing increase in variantb_main_6g.

4. **Process State Analysis**
   - The maximum CPU usage is similar across both variants for all processes (96.6%), the build process (varianta_main_4g: 82.6%, variantb_main_6g: 81.9%), and build child processes (varianta_main_4g: 87.3%, variantb_main_6g: 86.5%).
   - The maximum memory usage is slightly lower in variantb_main_6g for all processes (3.94 GB) and the build process (1.54 GB), but higher for build child processes (1.37 GB) compared to varianta_main_4g (all processes: 4.1 GB, build process: 1.79 GB, build child processes: 1.3 GB).

5. **CPU & Memory Usage Analysis**
   - The CPU usage is similar across both variants for all processes, the build process, and build child processes.
   - The memory usage is slightly lower in variantb_main_6g for all processes and the build process, but higher for build child processes.

6. **Garbage Collection Analysis**
   - Data for total GC collections is not available.

7. **Kotlin Build Reports Analysis**
   - Data for Kotlin build reports is not available.
