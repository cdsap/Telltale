## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals that variant B (main_6g) generally performs better than variant A (main_4g). Variant B has a shorter overall build time, with a mean difference of around 838ms. The most time-consuming tasks, such as 'KotlinCompile' and 'compileKotlin' for both 'build-logic:convention' and 'core:model', also take less time in variant B. CPU usage is slightly higher in variant B, but it uses less memory across all processes, the build process, and build child processes.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The overall build time for variant B (main_6g) is shorter than variant A (main_4g), with mean times of 43.057s and 43.895s respectively. This represents a 1.91% decrease in build time for variant B.
   
2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The most time-consuming tasks are 'KotlinCompile' and 'compileKotlin' for both 'build-logic:convention' and 'core:model'. All these tasks take less time in variant B, with 'KotlinCompile' showing a 1.95% decrease in mean time, 'compileKotlin' in 'build-logic:convention' showing a 2.4% decrease, and 'compileKotlin' in 'core:model' showing a 0.9% decrease.

3. **Statistical Patterns**
   - The tasks with notable timing variations are the same as the most time-consuming tasks. The P50 and P90 values for these tasks are consistently lower in variant B, indicating that it performs better for these specific task types.

4. **Process State Analysis**
   - The data for Kotlin Process State and Gradle Process State is not available.

5. **CPU & Memory Usage Analysis**
   - CPU usage is slightly higher in variant B for all processes (97% vs 96.3%), the build process (84.5% vs 82.9%), and build child processes (87% vs 87.7%). However, variant B uses less memory across all processes (3.99GB vs 4.07GB), the build process (1.58GB vs 1.7GB), and build child processes (1.37GB vs 1.3GB).

6. **Garbage Collection Analysis**
   - The data for total GC collections is not available.

7. **Kotlin Build Reports Analysis**
   - The data for Kotlin Build Reports is not available.
