## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals several key differences between the two variants, `varianta_main_g1` and `variantb_main_parallel`. Overall, `variantb_main_parallel` had a faster build time, with a mean build time of 200,583ms compared to `varianta_main_g1`'s 213,976ms. The most time-consuming tasks across both variants were `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, `com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask`, and `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspTaskJvm`. In terms of resource usage, both variants had a maximum CPU usage of 100%, but `varianta_main_g1` used more memory, with a maximum of 11.17GB compared to `variantb_main_parallel`'s 9.58GB. Finally, `varianta_main_g1` had more total garbage collections than `variantb_main_parallel`.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for `varianta_main_g1` was 213.976 seconds, while for `variantb_main_parallel` it was 200.583 seconds. This indicates that `variantb_main_parallel` was approximately 6.27% faster.
   - The P50 (median) build times were 213.017 seconds for `varianta_main_g1` and 198.736 seconds for `variantb_main_parallel`, a difference of approximately 6.69%.
   - The P90 build times were 221.042 seconds for `varianta_main_g1` and 207.289 seconds for `variantb_main_parallel`, a difference of approximately 6.22%.

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The top 3 most time-consuming tasks for both variants were `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, `com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask`, and `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspTaskJvm`.
   - For `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, the mean execution times were 3.925 seconds for `varianta_main_g1` and 3.668 seconds for `variantb_main_parallel`, a difference of approximately 6.55%.
   - For `com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask`, the mean execution times were 1.453 seconds for `varianta_main_g1` and 1.358 seconds for `variantb_main_parallel`, a difference of approximately 6.54%.
   - For `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspTaskJvm`, the mean execution times were 3.676 seconds for `varianta_main_g1` and 3.501 seconds for `variantb_main_parallel`, a difference of approximately 4.76%.

3. **Statistical Patterns**
   - The tasks with notable timing variations (>10% difference) between the two variants include `com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexMergingTask`, `com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.JacocoTask`, `com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexArchiveBuilderTask`, and `com.android.build.gradle.tasks.PackageApplication`.
   - For these tasks, `variantb_main_parallel` consistently performed better, with faster execution times.
