## Summary
The performance comparison between two Gradle build variants, `varianta_agp_8.12` and `variantb_agp_9-alpha02`, shows that the newer variant generally improves build performance. The mean build time decreased from 376.749 seconds in `varianta` to 370.775 seconds in `variantb`, a reduction of approximately 1.58%. The P50 and P90 values also show improvements with reductions of 1.58% and 5.44% respectively. Notably, the most time-consuming tasks across both variants include `:core:identity:compileDebugKotlin`, `:core:cart:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:app:app:mergeExtDexDebug`, with `variantb` showing slight improvements in execution times for these tasks. Memory and CPU usage metrics indicate marginal differences, with `variantb` generally using slightly less memory. The total garbage collection counts are very similar between the variants, suggesting stable memory management across builds.

- `variantb` shows a consistent trend of slight improvements across most tasks, particularly in those with higher execution times.

### 4. CPU & Memory Usage Analysis
- **CPU Usage:**
  - All processes maxed out at 100% for both variants.
  - Build process CPU usage was slightly higher in `variantb` (96.65% vs. 96.5%).
- **Memory Usage:**
  - All processes: `varianta` peaked at 10.73 GB, `variantb` at 10.63 GB.
  - Build process memory: `varianta` used up to 5.28 GB, `variantb` 5.12 GB.

### 6. Garbage Collection Analysis
- **Total GC Collections:**
  - `varianta_agp_8.12`: 141.0
  - `variantb_agp_9-alpha02`: 142.0
  - The slight increase in GC collections in `variantb` does not significantly impact overall performance.

In summary, `variantb_agp_9-alpha02` shows a modest but consistent improvement in build performance compared to `varianta_agp_8.12`, particularly in reducing the execution time of the most demanding tasks. Memory and CPU usage are slightly optimized in the newer variant, contributing to its enhanced performance.
