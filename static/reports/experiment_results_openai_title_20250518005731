 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals a notable improvement in overall build times when comparing variant B (metro_0_3_2) to variant A (anvil). Specifically, variant B is faster by approximately 6.7 seconds (26.012s for A vs. 19.291s for B), translating to a 25.8% decrease in build time. This improvement is consistent across the 50th and 90th percentiles as well. In task execution, the `:app-scaffold:compileDebugKotlin` task shows a significant increase in execution time in variant B, while `:app-scaffold:kspDebugKotlin` is notably faster. The Kotlin build reports highlight a substantial increase in IR translation time for variant B, suggesting a potential area for optimization. Memory and CPU usage are slightly higher in variant B for all processes, with the build child processes in variant B utilizing significantly more CPU resources. Lastly, garbage collection data indicates fewer total collections in variant B, suggesting more efficient memory management.
