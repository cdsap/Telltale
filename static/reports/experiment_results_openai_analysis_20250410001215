## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data between two variants reveals notable differences in build times and task execution times. Variant B (`variantb_z/metro`) shows a faster overall build time with a mean reduction of 20.42 seconds (13.4% faster) compared to Variant A (`varianta_main`). Key tasks such as `com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.MapSourceSetPathsTask` and `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspAATask` also exhibit significant time reductions in Variant B. Memory usage is slightly lower in Variant B across all processes, with a maximum memory usage of 6.9 GB compared to 7.04 GB in Variant A. CPU usage is nearly identical for both variants, maxing out at 100% for all processes.

- Tasks such as `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspAATask` and `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile` show more than 10% increase in execution times in Variant B, indicating potential areas for optimization.

### 5. CPU & Memory Usage Analysis
- **All Processes:**
  - CPU Usage: Max 100% for both variants.
  - Memory Usage: Max 7.04 GB for Variant A, 6.9 GB for Variant B.
- **Build Process:**
  - CPU Usage: Max 94.94% for Variant A, 95.04% for Variant B.
  - Memory Usage: Max 3.35 GB for Variant A, 3.14 GB for Variant B.
- **Build Child Processes:**
  - CPU Usage: Max 89.48% for Variant A, 90.14% for Variant B.
  - Memory Usage: Max 2.71 GB for Variant A, 2.77 GB for Variant B.

### 7. Kotlin Build Reports Analysis
- **Compiler Performance Metrics:**
  - **Code Generation Lines per Second:** Variant A: 695, Variant B: 550.
  - **Analysis Lines per Second:** Variant A: 457, Variant B: 310.
- **Incremental Compilation Insights:**
  - Incremental compilation time in daemon for Variant A: 3949.34 ms, Variant B: 4599.33 ms.
- **Classpath and Cache Insights:**
  - Number of cache hits when loading classpath entries: Variant A: 26, Variant B: 24.

The data indicates that while Variant B generally performs better in terms of build time and memory usage, there are specific areas, particularly in Kotlin compilation tasks, where Variant A performs more efficiently. This suggests a trade-off between build speed and task-specific performance that might be optimized further.
