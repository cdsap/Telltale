 
The Gradle build performance comparison data shows very similar performance between the two variants, with the difference in build times being less than 1%. The most time-consuming tasks were 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin', and ':core:model:compileKotlin', with minimal differences in execution times between the two variants. CPU usage was almost identical across all processes, while memory usage was slightly lower in variant B.
