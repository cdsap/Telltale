## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison between `varianta_main` and `variantb_lint_2g` reveals several key findings. The overall build time for `variantb_lint_2g` is longer by approximately 73 seconds (7.3% increase) compared to `varianta_main`. In task execution, the most significant difference is observed in the `:layer_0:module_0_1:lintAnalyzeDebug` task, where `variantb_lint_2g` takes about 13.64 seconds longer than `varianta_main`. Memory and CPU usage across all processes are relatively similar between the two variants, with slight variations in peak values. The total garbage collection (GC) count was lower in `variantb_lint_2g` by 73 collections, indicating potentially more efficient memory management.
