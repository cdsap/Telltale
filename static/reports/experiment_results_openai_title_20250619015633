 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals several key insights across different metrics and task types. The overall build times for `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` averaged around 878.54 seconds, slightly slower than `variantb_8.14.2` at 869.71 seconds, showing a minor difference of about 1%. Among the most time-consuming tasks, `:layer_0:module_0_1:compileDebugKotlin` and related Kotlin compilation tasks consistently took longer in `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` compared to `variantb_8.14.2`. Memory usage was slightly higher in `variantb_8.14.2` with a maximum of 12.75 GB compared to 12.67 GB in `varianta_9.0.0-rc1`. CPU usage for all processes hit the maximum of 100% for both variants, indicating full utilization during the build. The total garbage collection counts were slightly higher in `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` for both Gradle and Kotlin processes, suggesting a bit more frequent memory cleanup.
