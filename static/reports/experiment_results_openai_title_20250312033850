 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals several key differences between the two variants, `varianta_main_g1` and `variantb_main_parallel`. Overall, `variantb_main_parallel` had a faster build time, with a mean build time of 200,583ms compared to `varianta_main_g1`'s 213,976ms. The most time-consuming tasks across both variants were `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`, `com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask`, and `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspTaskJvm`. In terms of resource usage, both variants had a maximum CPU usage of 100%, but `varianta_main_g1` used more memory, with a maximum of 11.17GB compared to `variantb_main_parallel`'s 9.58GB. Finally, `varianta_main_g1` had more total garbage collections than `variantb_main_parallel`.
