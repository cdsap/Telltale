 
The Gradle build performance comparison shows that the build times between the two variants are almost identical with a mean difference of just 99ms (0.05%). The variant with the Kotlin compiler and 3 workers (variantb_kotlin_compiler_3_workers) has slightly higher P90 values in most tasks, indicating that it might be slower in worst-case scenarios. The most time-consuming tasks across both variants are `:app:l8DexDesugarLibDemoDebug`, `:app:mergeExtDexDemoDebug`, and `:core:designsystem:compileDemoDebugKotlin`. Notably, the `:app:mergeExtDexDemoDebug` task is faster in variantb_kotlin_compiler_3_workers by 10.3%. CPU and memory usage are almost identical between the two variants.
