## Summary

The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals several key findings. The overall build time for variantb_main_6g is slightly faster than varianta_main_4g, with a mean time of 43.479 seconds compared to 44.617 seconds. The most time-consuming tasks across both variants are 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin', and ':core:model:compileKotlin'. Notably, all these tasks take less time in variantb_main_6g. CPU usage is almost identical for both variants, but variantb_main_6g uses less memory across all processes, the build process, and build child processes.

## Detailed Report

1. **Build Time Comparison**
   - The mean build time for varianta_main_4g is 44.617 seconds, while for variantb_main_6g it is 43.479 seconds, indicating that variantb_main_6g is faster by 1.138 seconds or 2.55%.

2. **Task Type Differences**
   - The top 3 most time-consuming tasks for both variants are 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile', ':build-logic:convention:compileKotlin', and ':core:model:compileKotlin'. All these tasks take less time in variantb_main_6g, with differences ranging from 1.55% to 3.28%.
