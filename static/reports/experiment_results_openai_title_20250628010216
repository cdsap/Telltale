 
The performance comparison between two Gradle build variants shows notable differences in build times and resource usage. Variant B generally exhibits longer build times with a mean build time of 617.338 seconds compared to Variant A's 569.857 seconds, marking an 8.3% increase. The most time-consuming tasks in Variant B are consistently longer than in Variant A, particularly `:layer_0:module_0_1:kspDebugKotlin` which takes 14.614 seconds in Variant B versus 10.220 seconds in Variant A. Memory usage is also higher in Variant B with a maximum of 11.73 GB compared to 11.45 GB in Variant A. CPU usage for the build process is slightly higher in Variant B at 96.98% compared to 96.32% in Variant A. Garbage collection activities are more frequent in Variant B with 280 total collections compared to 204 in Variant A, indicating potential inefficiencies in memory management.
