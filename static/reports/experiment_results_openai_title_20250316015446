 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data reveals that variant B (main_6g) generally performs better than variant A (main_4g). Variant B has a shorter overall build time, with a mean difference of around 838ms. The most time-consuming tasks, such as 'KotlinCompile' and 'compileKotlin' for both 'build-logic:convention' and 'core:model', also take less time in variant B. CPU usage is slightly higher in variant B, but it uses less memory across all processes, the build process, and build child processes.
