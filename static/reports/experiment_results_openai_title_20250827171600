 
The performance comparison between two Gradle build variants, `varianta_agp_8.12` and `variantb_agp_9-alpha02`, shows that the newer variant generally improves build performance. The mean build time decreased from 376.749 seconds in `varianta` to 370.775 seconds in `variantb`, a reduction of approximately 1.58%. The P50 and P90 values also show improvements with reductions of 1.58% and 5.44% respectively. Notably, the most time-consuming tasks across both variants include `:core:identity:compileDebugKotlin`, `:core:cart:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:app:app:mergeExtDexDebug`, with `variantb` showing slight improvements in execution times for these tasks. Memory and CPU usage metrics indicate marginal differences, with `variantb` generally using slightly less memory. The total garbage collection counts are very similar between the variants, suggesting stable memory management across builds.
