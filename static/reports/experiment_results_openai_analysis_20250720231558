## Summary
The detailed analysis of Gradle build performance between two variants reveals marginal differences in build times, with variantb_9.0.0-rc3 generally showing slight improvements over varianta_8.14.2. The mean build time for variantb is approximately 877.819 seconds compared to varianta's 878.069 seconds, indicating a minor reduction. Notable task execution times, such as for `:layer_0:module_0_1:kspDebugKotlin`, show significant increases in variantb, suggesting potential areas for optimization. Memory usage across all processes shows a slight increase in variantb, with a maximum of 13.2 GB compared to 12.84 GB in varianta. CPU usage remains high in both variants, maxing out at 100%. The total garbage collection counts are very close, with 268 for varianta and 269 for variantb, indicating similar memory management behavior.
