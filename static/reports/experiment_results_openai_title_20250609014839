 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals a slight increase in overall build time when comparing variant B (AGP 8.10.1) to variant A. Specifically, the mean build time for variant B is approximately 0.61 seconds longer than variant A, representing a 0.6% increase. The P90 build times show a more pronounced difference, with variant B taking about 6.24 seconds longer than variant A, a 2.7% increase. In task execution, the most significant time differences are observed in tasks like `:app:transformDemoDebugClassesWithAsm` and `:app:jacocoDemoDebug`, where variant B shows increased execution times. Memory and CPU usage across all processes and specifically for the build processes are relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The total garbage collection (GC) counts are slightly higher in variant B for both Gradle and Kotlin processes, indicating a marginal increase in memory management activities.
