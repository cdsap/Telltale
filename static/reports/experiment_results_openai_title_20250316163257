 
The comparison between the two Gradle build variants, `varianta_main_4g` and `variantb_main_6g`, shows minor differences in build times and task execution times. However, there are noticeable differences in CPU and memory usage. The `variantb_main_6g` variant shows lower memory usage across all processes, the build process, and build child processes. However, `variantb_main_6g` has slightly higher CPU usage for build child processes.
