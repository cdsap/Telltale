 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison data between two variants reveals notable differences in build times and task execution times. Variant B (`variantb_z/metro`) shows a faster overall build time with a mean reduction of 20.42 seconds (13.4% faster) compared to Variant A (`varianta_main`). Key tasks such as `com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.MapSourceSetPathsTask` and `com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspAATask` also exhibit significant time reductions in Variant B. Memory usage is slightly lower in Variant B across all processes, with a maximum memory usage of 6.9 GB compared to 7.04 GB in Variant A. CPU usage is nearly identical for both variants, maxing out at 100% for all processes.
