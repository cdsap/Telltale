 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals that variant B (Gradle 8.14 rc2) generally exhibits slightly longer build times compared to variant A (Gradle 8.13). Specifically, the mean build time for variant B is about 5.06% longer, translating to an increase of approximately 29.1 seconds. Notably, the P90 times also show a similar trend with variant B taking roughly 39.8 seconds longer. In task execution, the most significant differences are observed in tasks like `:feature:foryou:kspDemoDebugKotlin` and `:app:mergeExtDexDemoDebug`, where variant B is slower by significant margins. CPU and memory usage are relatively consistent between variants, with minor fluctuations. The total garbage collection (GC) counts are slightly lower in variant B for both Gradle and Kotlin processes, suggesting a marginal improvement in memory management efficiency.
