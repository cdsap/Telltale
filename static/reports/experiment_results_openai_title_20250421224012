 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance between two variants, `varianta_gradle_8_13` and `variantb_gradle_8_14_rc2`, reveals minor differences in build times and task execution. The mean build time for `varianta` is 215.687 seconds, slightly higher than `variantb` at 215.076 seconds, showing a marginal improvement of 0.28%. Key tasks such as `KotlinCompile`, `LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask`, and `KspTaskJvm` show minor fluctuations in execution times between the two variants, with differences generally under 10%. Memory and CPU usage for all processes and specifically for the build process are nearly identical across variants, with maximum CPU usage hitting 100% for all processes in both variants. The total garbage collection counts in Gradle and Kotlin processes are also similar, indicating consistent memory management behavior between the two variants.
