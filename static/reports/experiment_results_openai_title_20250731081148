 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison between two variants reveals significant differences in build times and resource utilization. Variant B (`variantb_2.2.20-Beta2`) has a much longer mean build time of 4781.554 seconds compared to 744.363 seconds for Variant A (`varianta_2.2.0`), showing a drastic increase of over 542%. Notably, tasks related to Kotlin compilation (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`) and various Android build tasks (`com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexMergingTask`) are among the top time-consuming tasks, with Variant B showing substantial increases in execution times. CPU and memory usage are also higher in Variant B, particularly in build child processes where memory usage is significantly lower than Variant A, suggesting possible inefficiencies or different configurations affecting performance.
