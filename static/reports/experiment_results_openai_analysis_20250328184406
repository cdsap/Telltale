## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals a slight increase in overall build time for `variantb_main_lint` compared to `varianta_main_lint_with_memory`, with a mean build time of 225.177 seconds versus 219.146 seconds, respectively, marking a 2.75% increase. The P90 value for `variantb_main_lint` shows a more pronounced increase, suggesting higher variability under heavier loads. The most time-consuming tasks across variants include `:core:designsystem:compileProdReleaseKotlin` and `:core:analytics:lintAnalyzeProdRelease`, with significant time differences noted in tasks like `:app:parseProdReleaseLocalResources`, which nearly doubled in execution time in `variantb_main_lint`. Memory usage peaked slightly higher in `variantb_main_lint` at 10.14 GB compared to 10.35 GB for `varianta_main_lint_with_memory`, indicating more efficient memory usage in the latter despite its quicker build time. CPU usage was maximized at 100% for all processes in both variants, showing full utilization.
