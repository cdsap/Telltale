 
The performance comparison between Gradle build variants `varianta_9.0.0` and `variantb_9.1.0-rc-1` reveals a slight increase in overall build time in the newer variant by approximately 2.36 seconds (1.16% increase). Notably, the `hiltJavaCompileDebug` task in `variantb_9.1.0-rc-1` shows a significant improvement, reducing its execution time by almost 50%. However, this variant also exhibits increased execution times for several Kotlin compilation tasks (`kspDebugKotlin`), particularly in the `domain` and `repository` modules. Memory usage across all processes is slightly reduced in the newer variant, while CPU usage remains maximally utilized in both variants. The total garbage collection counts remain unchanged across variants.
