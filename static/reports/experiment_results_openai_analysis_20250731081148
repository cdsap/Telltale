## Summary
The analysis of the Gradle build performance comparison between two variants reveals significant differences in build times and resource utilization. Variant B (`variantb_2.2.20-Beta2`) has a much longer mean build time of 4781.554 seconds compared to 744.363 seconds for Variant A (`varianta_2.2.0`), showing a drastic increase of over 542%. Notably, tasks related to Kotlin compilation (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile`) and various Android build tasks (`com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexMergingTask`) are among the top time-consuming tasks, with Variant B showing substantial increases in execution times. CPU and memory usage are also higher in Variant B, particularly in build child processes where memory usage is significantly lower than Variant A, suggesting possible inefficiencies or different configurations affecting performance.

## Detailed Report

### 1. Build Time Comparison
- **Mean Build Time:**
  - Variant A: 744.363 seconds
  - Variant B: 4781.554 seconds
- **Percentage Increase:** 542.3%
- **P50 Build Time:**
  - Variant A: 745.078 seconds
  - Variant B: 4748.272 seconds
- **P90 Build Time:**
  - Variant A: 765.304 seconds
  - Variant B: 4976.704 seconds

### 2. Task Type Differences
- **Top 3 Time-Consuming Tasks:**
  - `"org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile"`:
    - Variant A Mean: 2.171 seconds; Variant B Mean: 29.446 seconds
  - `"com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexMergingTask"`:
    - Variant A Mean: 5.552 seconds; Variant B Mean: 6.843 seconds
  - `"com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.KspTaskJvm"`:
    - Variant A Mean: 3.028 seconds; Variant B Mean: 21.377 seconds

### 3. Statistical Patterns
- Significant timing variations are observed in Kotlin compilation tasks and Android resource linking tasks, with Variant B consistently underperforming by a large margin.

### 4. CPU & Memory Usage Analysis
- **Overall System Usage:**
  - CPU Max: 100% for both variants.
  - Memory Max: 13.67 GB for Variant A, 9.84 GB for Variant B.
- **Main Gradle Process:**
  - CPU Max: 96.625% for Variant A, 96.512% for Variant B.
  - Memory Max: 8.36 GB for Variant A, 8.29 GB for Variant B.
- **Build Child Processes:**
  - CPU Max: 95.525% for Variant A, 96.282% for Variant B.
  - Memory Max: 4.88 GB for Variant A, 2.85 GB for Variant B (notably lower in Variant B).

### 5. Garbage Collection Analysis
- **Total GC Collections:**
  - Variant A: 217.0
  - Variant B: 281.0
- This indicates more frequent garbage collections in Variant B, which could be contributing to the longer build times.

### 6. Kotlin Build Reports Analysis
- **Compiler Execution Stages Comparison:**
  - Variant B spends significantly more time in almost all stages of the Kotlin build process, particularly in running compilation in the Gradle worker (29361.42 ms in Variant B vs. 2028.01 ms in Variant A).

### 7. Summary of Findings
- Variant B's build performance is substantially slower across all metrics compared to Variant A.
- The increased build time in Variant B is accompanied by higher CPU usage but lower memory usage in build child processes, suggesting a potential area for optimization.
- The frequent garbage collections in Variant B are a concern and might be an area to investigate for performance improvements.
