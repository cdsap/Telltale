 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals several key insights between the two variants, `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` and `variantb_8.14.2`. The overall build time for `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` is slightly higher at approximately 879 seconds compared to `variantb_8.14.2` at around 878 seconds, showing a minimal difference. Notably, specific tasks such as `:layer_0:module_0_1:compileDebugKotlin` and `:layer_0:module_0_12:compileDebugKotlin` show significant execution time differences, indicating potential areas for optimization. Memory usage across all processes is higher in `varianta_9.0.0-rc1` with a maximum of 12.73 GB compared to 11.99 GB in `variantb_8.14.2`. The CPU usage for the build process is nearly maxed out for both variants, suggesting a CPU-bound scenario. Additionally, the total garbage collection counts are identical for both variants, which might indicate similar memory management efficiency.
