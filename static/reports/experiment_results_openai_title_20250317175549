 
The Gradle build performance comparison data reveals that variant B (`variantb_main_parallel`) generally performs better than variant A (`varianta_main_g1`). The mean build time for variant B is approximately 14.3 seconds, which is 6.6% faster than variant A's mean build time of around 21.5 seconds. The most time-consuming tasks across both variants are `:app:l8DexDesugarLibDemoDebug`, `:app:mergeExtDexDemoDebug`, and `:core:designsystem:compileDemoDebugKotlin`. Significant differences in task execution times are observed in `:app:transformDemoDebugClassesWithAsm` and `:core:designsystem:bundleLibCompileToJarDemoDebug`. The CPU and memory usage are also slightly lower for variant B.
