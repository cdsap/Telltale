 
The analysis of Gradle build performance between two variants, `varianta_agp_8.12` and `variantb_agp_9-alpha01`, reveals a slight increase in overall build time in the newer variant by approximately 0.35 seconds (0.35% increase). The configuration time also shows a minor increase by about 0.09 seconds (2.15% increase). The most time-consuming tasks across both variants include `:core:cart:compileDebugKotlin`, `:core:identity:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:core:contact:compileDebugKotlin`, with marginal differences in execution times between the variants. Memory usage is slightly higher in `variantb_agp_9-alpha01` for all processes and specifically for build child processes. CPU usage remains nearly identical across both variants. The total garbage collection counts are slightly reduced in the newer variant.
