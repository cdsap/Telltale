 
The analysis of the Gradle build performance data reveals subtle yet insightful differences between two Kotlin variants, `varianta_kotlin_2.1.21` and `variantb_kotlin_2.2.0`. The overall build time shows a slight improvement in `variantb` by approximately 0.42 seconds (0.4% faster). Notably, the most time-consuming tasks across variants include `:layer_0:module_0_1:kspDebugKotlin`, `:layer_0:module_0_10:kspDebugKotlin`, and `:layer_0:module_0_12:kspDebugKotlin`, with `variantb` generally showing marginal increases in execution times. CPU and memory usage are closely matched between the variants, with `variantb` showing a slight increase in maximum memory usage by about 0.09 GB. Garbage collection metrics indicate a very similar performance, with total collections slightly lower in `variantb`. The Kotlin Build Reports highlight a faster compiler code generation and analysis in `variantb`, suggesting efficiency improvements in the newer Kotlin version.
